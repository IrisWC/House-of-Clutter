##Try it out!
To try out the project, first download everything as a zip folder (click on the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP"). 
Then, unzip the file and run the jar file inside (called "House of Clutter.jar"). <br/>
This should work on most computers unless your computer protection system tries to block the file or you don't have java downloaded.
